SpyFall is a party game that can be played with four or more players. At the start of each round, all the players receive a location – a casino, a travelling circus, a pirate ship or even a space station – except the spies that don’t know the place. Then, players start asking each other yes or no questions – “Do you like to go there?” – trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spies don't know where they are, so they have to listen carefully to guess the location and remain undetectable. At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If most players agree with the accusation, the accused player has to reveal his identity. The round just ends when all the spies are uncovered or when one of them announces the correct secret location.
